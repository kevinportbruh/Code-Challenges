Kevin Portillo, Self-Proclaimed Code Wizard üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è presents a spell book of various coding challenges I've attempted or completed!
I enjoy doing these in the morning as brain teaser, like someones daily sodku with their morning coffee.

I did most of the Kattis solutions for a Comptetive Programming Course and some contests, as such about 2/3rds of the solutions are good!
As for Leet Code, I do those on my free time and so pretty much all of them are good!

As you can see one of my stronger languages is Java! I have a love hate relationship with it. 
For Software development, its use of classes and strong OOP principles it is a top tier, solid language.
A personal challenge/goal of mine is to get better at different langauges for these coding challenges. I love the low-level, close to the metal freedom that C/C++ gives you, but when it comes to speediness in my responses, as expected on Skill assmenets for jobs or Competitive Programming, I fall back on ol' reliable Java as I am simply more familiar with the java apis and libraries than I am with C++'s STL.
I also want to attempt to use Haskell to solve some of these coding problems. I recently worked with Haskell over a semester and fell in love with functional programming. Some would aruge that I should learn python instead as its easier, but thats exactly why I want to avoid python. I love the lower-level stuff so much more, and if I am going to go with a higher level language I would like on as type secure as Haskell as it has that reliablity during run-time.
Thank you for reading my ramblings! I will be pushing to this pretty consistently.
